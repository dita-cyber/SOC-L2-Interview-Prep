SOC Analyst Level 2 interview preparation 2025

I have been reviewing some materials for an interview for a Level 2 SOC Analyst position, leveraging both technical knowledge and practical experience from my time as a SOC Level 1 Analyst. I found this approach to be a valuable way to organize my concepts and reference them as needed. The content I've compiled mainly comes from my GCIH certification materials and various cybersecurity articles from leading companies. Additionally, I used AI to gain further insights. 

The material is mainly focused for a MSSP environment and as an L2, I should be familiar with answering the common investigative questions for endpoint related incidents, like:

•	How something got to the asset - Initial Access Vector<br/>
•	Is it still there? - Persistence<br/>
•	Where did they go? - Lateral Movement<br/>
•	Prove that something was taken - Data Exfiltration<br/>

Those topics above where a very good start to guide me thorough what to review. Additionally, I added more topics as I was reviewing and remembering content that I already knew but needed a refresh or a more structure understanding to be able to explain.
