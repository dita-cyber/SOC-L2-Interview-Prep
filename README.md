#SOC Analyst Level 2 position interview 2025#

I have been reviewing some materials for an interview for a Level 2 SOC Analyst position, leveraging both technical knowledge and practical experience from my time as a SOC Level 1 Analyst. I found this approach to be a valuable way to organize my concepts and reference them as needed. The content I've compiled mainly comes from my GCIH certification materials and various cybersecurity articles from leading companies. Additionally, I used AI to gain further insights. 

As an L2, I should be familiar with answering the common investigative questions for endpoint related incidents, like:

•	How something got to the asset - Initial Access Vector  
•	Is it still there? - Persistence 
•	Where did they go? - Lateral Movement
•	Prove that something was taken - Data Exfiltration

Those topics above where a very good start to guide me thorough what to review. Additionally I added more topics as I was reviewing and remembering content that I already knew but needed a refresh or a more structure understanding to be able to explain.
